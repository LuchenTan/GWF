# NetCDF
## 1. What is NetCDF?
The Network Comman Data Form, or [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/) is **a set of software libraries** 
and self-describing, machine-independant **data formats**. It supports the creation, access and sharing of scientific data. 

To make data "self-describing" and meaningful to both humans and machines, the names, units of measure and other metadata should be meaningful and conform to **Conventions**. 

## 2. What can be seen in a NetCDF file?
NetCDF files should have the file name extension "**.nc**". A classic netCDF format file should not be larger than 2GB, except on platforms that have "Large File Support"(LFS). 

A netCDF file comprises two parts: a header part and a data part.
..* Header part: contains all the information/metadata about dimensions, attributes and variables. 
..* Data part: fixed-size data (the data for variables without unlimited dimension); variable-size data (the data for variables with unlimited dimension)
